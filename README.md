## Overview
In this repo, I did a Time Series analysis on energy and temperature data in Spain from 01/01/2015 - 12/31/2018. Energy data pertained to hourly energy consumptiom, production, and price while temperature data pertained to hourly temperature and weather conditions.

The goal of this analysis was to outperform the predictions made by the Transmission Service Operator (TSO) for hourly energy price and demand by using different Machine Learning Techniques including:
* ARIMA
* Linear Regression
* RNN'ss
